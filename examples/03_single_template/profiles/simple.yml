    # Instead of using the name from the source file (`hello.template`)
    # this option can be used to overwrite it.
    # This can either be a relative path, then it will be appended to the profile target:
    target: "hello.txt"
  - path: "hello.template"
    # ... or it can be a absolute path, which will completely ignore the profile target:
    target: "/hello.txt"
